## Best practices for HAP Learning Labs

### Code examples standards

**Always use "Old Way" vs "What I Learned" pattern**:

```css
/* HAP's Old Way ([DESCRIPTION OF MISTAKE]) */
[Incorrect approach with comments showing confusion]

/* What I Learned */
[Correct approach with educational comments]
```

**Comment standards**:

- Use `<p class="code-comment">` after code blocks
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
- Reference HAP's learning moments
- Include mathematical explanations where applicable

### HAP's voice consistency

**First-person narrative**:

- "I used to..." not "You might..."
- "Prof. Teeters taught me..." not "Experts recommend..."
- "This was confusing for me too!" not "This is confusing!"

**Specific struggles**:

- Reference actual mistakes from this content plan
- Show vulnerability and learning
- Make it relatable to student experience

**Enthusiasm balanced with humility**:

- Excited about discoveries but acknowledges difficulty
- Credits Prof. Teeters for teaching
- Shares "aha moments" genuinely

### Navigation standards

**Top navigation** (`.page-navigation`):

- Link back to hub (left)
- Station number indicator (center)
- Next station link (right)
- Use semantic markup with `<nav>` element

**Bottom navigation**:

- Clear "Next up" indicator
- Link to next station with descriptive text
- Link back to hub
- Always include footer with copyright

### Image optimization

**HAP images**:

- Use Cloudinary CDN with optimization parameters
- Header avatar: `fetchpriority="high"` (LCP image)
- Below-fold images: `loading="lazy"`
- Always include explicit `width` and `height`
- Use `decoding="async"` for better performance

**Alt text formula**:

```html
<img src="[cloudinary-url]"
     alt="HAP (HyBit A. ProtoBot) [doing activity/showing emotion]"
     width="[width]"
     height="[height]"
     fetchpriority="high" OR loading="lazy"
     decoding="async">
```

### Technical review checklist

Before considering a station complete:

- [ ] All HAP images use appropriate alt text
- [ ] ARIA live regions included for dynamic content
- [ ] WCAG contrast ratios specified with exact numbers (4.5:1, 3:1)
- [ ] Warning boxes placed near code that could fail accessibility
- [ ] Code examples follow "Old Way" vs "What I Learned" structure
- [ ] Educational comments explain the math/logic
- [ ] Top and bottom navigation work correctly
- [ ] All interactive elements have proper aria-labels
- [ ] Copy buttons provide screen reader feedback
- [ ] HAP's voice is first-person throughout
- [ ] Specific struggles from content plan are referenced
- [ ] Images optimized with correct loading strategy
- [ ] Test locally with live-server before review
- [ ] Run Lighthouse audit (target: 99+ performance, 100 accessibility)

## Checklist before starting customization

- [ ] All 6 station titles are finalized
- [ ] HAP's learning journey is consistent across stations
- [ ] Learning objectives align with student problems
- [ ] Interactive demos specified for each station
- [ ] Code shows "Old Way" vs "What I Learned"
- [ ] Resources are practical and current
- [ ] Voice maintains HAP's enthusiasm and humility
- [ ] Each station builds on previous knowledge

## Usage notes

**How to use this template**:

1. Fill in all `[PLACEHOLDER]` sections
2. Write HAP's stories in first-person voice
3. List specific, relatable mistakes for each station
4. Create 3 key insights per station (not more, not less)
5. Design 2-3 interactive demos per station
6. Always include "Old Way" vs "What I Learned" code examples
7. Reference actual documentation URLs in resources

**HAP's voice guidelines**:

- Be specific about mistakes ("I had 73 different color values!")
- Show vulnerability ("I was so confused...")
- Credit Prof. Teeters for teaching ("Prof. Teeters showed me...")
- Use enthusiasm markers (emoji, exclamation points)
- Make it relatable ("This was my biggest breakthrough!")

**Content flow**:

- Station 1: Introduce the problem
- Stations 2-4: Build core skills progressively
- Station 5: Advanced techniques
- Station 6: Future-facing or AI-assisted approaches

**Keep consistent**:

- Same HAP personality across all stations
- Progressive difficulty (don't jump ahead)
- Reference previous stations when building on concepts
- Maintain the apprentice learning narrative
